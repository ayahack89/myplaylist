# Vibelist — personal music playground

A focused, frontend-only app for browsing short music previews and curating a personal playlist. Built as a demo / learning project — not affiliated with the commercial streaming services.

## Live demo

[https://myplaylist-beige.vercel.app/](https://myplaylist-beige.vercel.app/)


## Key points

* Frontend-only; no backend or user accounts.
* Uses public music APIs for metadata and short preview clips (≈30s).
* Not a licensed streaming service — use licensed providers for full tracks.
* Designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly.

## Features

* Browse curated playlists and search the iTunes API.
* Save tracks to **My Playlist**.
* Drag & drop tracks between lists (Kanban-style).
* API results are shuffled before rendering to avoid album/artist grouping.
* Lightweight UI with a persistent audio preview player.

## Tech stack

* Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla).
* iTunes Search API for metadata and preview URLs.
* Static-host friendly (example: Vercel, GitHub Pages).

## Notes & legal

This project only fetches metadata and short preview clips from public APIs. For full-length streaming or commercial use you must obtain licenses from appropriate providers (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.). Use this project for education, demo, and personal playlists only.
